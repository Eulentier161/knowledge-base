#### General troubleshooting steps
- Refer to [First things to try](#first-things-to-try) above.
- Make sure you are not trying to install to an NTFS-formatted drive.
- Be sure you haven't changed the default install path in the RSI Launcher settings. If you wish to install the game elsewhere, put the entire wine prefix there instead.


#### Wine prefix creation failed
- LUG Helper install log shows error similar to `warning: WINE is /path/to/.../bin/wine, which is neither on the path nor an executable file`
- To fix, make sure the mount point is not marked `noexec`


#### Launcher installation hangs at Updating Game Content
- The Launcher sometimes hangs during this phase of the install process
- Completely quit the launcher, ensuring no lingering wine processes remain, then verify files


#### Wine install fails to create .desktop files
- Manually create a file `~/.local/share/applications/RSI Launcher.desktop` based on the following template.
- Edit paths based on your install, then update the cache by running `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications`
  ```
